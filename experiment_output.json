Additionally, report per-task effects to reveal whether gains are concentrated in tasks susceptible to cue leakage and rerun experiments with paraphrased CoT prompts to confirm robustness.\n\nA second plausible confound is differences in decoding and randomness: CoT prompting may interact with sampling temperature, beam size, or stopping heuristics so improvements reflect decoding artifacts rather than better internal reasoning. To address this, hold decoding hyperparameters constant across conditions (use the same temperature, top-k/p, and beam settings), run multiple random seeds and report mean and variance, and include deterministic decoding (greedy/beam) comparisons. Finally, perform cross-model and cross-dataset replication and apply appropriate statistical tests (e.g., paired tests across examples) to ensure the effect is consistent and not due to idiosyncratic sampling noise.",

Additional risks include lateral movement if commands run with elevated privileges, OS-level escape via command substitution or metacharacters, and data leakage through network calls or file writes initiated by generated commands. Regular expression sanitizers or naive filters are often insufficient because sophisticated payloads exploit parsing ambiguities or the agent’s instruction-following behavior.\nTop mitigations ranked by effectiveness are: 1) strict command whitelisting and a minimal allowed-subset execution layer, 2) using a sandboxed execution environment with resource and system-call restrictions, 3) explicit structured command schema with typed argument validation, 4) human-in-the-loop approval for any non-trivial or high-risk commands, and 5) provenance tagging and auditing with rate limits and network egress controls.

Strict sanitization and principled synthesis means using a deterministic parser that maps only well-understood email constructs to a tightly-controlled set of command templates, rejecting or flagging any unexpected tokens or ambiguous instructions—this prevents semantic reinterpretation of attacker text. Execution isolation and least privilege (containerization, unprivileged user, syscall filters like seccomp, and an allowlist of permitted commands/flags) limit the blast radius if synthesis is imperfect; combined with policy-enforced manual approval or a safe-mode dry-run for risky commands, this provides a practical safety net.

      "reason": "Both answers present plausible causal stories and appropriate tests, but B is slightly stronger: it clearly identifies false positives/friction as mechanisms, lists concrete intermediate metrics (blocked content rate, time-to-post, help requests), specifies stratified RCT/staggered rollout, survival analysis, DiD with pre-trend/placebo checks, heterogeneity and robustness strategies (thresholds, instrumenting exposure). A is good on signaling and demotion but is a bit more high-level.",
